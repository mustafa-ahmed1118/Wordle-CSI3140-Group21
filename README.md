This is our implementation of Wordle. It was made with HTML/CSS and JavaScript. For more details about the design, click the link : [Design Document](/docs/design_system.md)

## How to Play

1. Deploy the server called `server.php` in a local host server (ie `http://localhost:3000/versions/v02/server.php`).

2. Navigate in the browser to the `index.html` file in your local host server (ie `http://localhost:3000/versions/v02/index.html`).

3. Begin guessing words using your keyboard!
