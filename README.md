This is our implementation of Wordle. It was made with HTML/CSS JavaScript and PHP. For more details about the design, click the link : [Design Document](/docs/design_system.md)

## How to Play

1. With PHP downloaded on your computer, navigate to the v03 directory on your terminal.

2. Create a database on MySQL, change the specifications in the PHP to match your database, and run all the queries in the SQL file in MySQL.

3. In the terminal, type the following cmd to deploy a PHP server at localhost 3000: `php -S localhost:3000` (use `killall -9 php` to turn off PHP server).

4. With the server now running, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/index.html` in your chosen web browser.

5. Begin guessing words using your keyboard!
