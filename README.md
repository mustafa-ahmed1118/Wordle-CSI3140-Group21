## How to Play

1. With PHP downloaded on your computer, navigate to the v02 directory on your terminal.

2. In the terminal, type the following cmd to deploy a PHP server at localhost 3000: `php -S localhost:3000` (use `killall -9 php` to turn off PHP server).

3. With the server now running, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/index.html` in you chosen web browser.

4. Begin guessing words using your keyboard!
